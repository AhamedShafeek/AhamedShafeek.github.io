## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Don't Do This:

❌ **Over-promoting products** - Follow 80/20 rule: 80% value/stories, 20% promotion
❌ **Ghostwriting that sounds corporate** - Your audience wants YOU, not a PR team
❌ **Posting without engaging** - Social media is two-way; comment on others' content
❌ **Buying followers/engagement** - Kills your reach algorithm and credibility
❌ **Ignoring negative comments** - Address concerns professionally and promptly
❌ **Inconsistency** - One week of posts then silence kills momentum
❌ **Talking only about wins** - Vulnerability builds deeper connections
❌ **Using too many hashtags on LinkedIn** - 3-5 max; more looks spammy

### Do This Instead:

✅ **Share 80% value, 20% pitch** - Be helpful first, salesperson second
✅ **Write like you talk** - Record voice memos of your thoughts, then transcribe
✅ **Engage before you post** - Spend 15 min commenting, then share your content
✅ **Focus on quality audience** - 1,000 engaged followers > 10,000 ghost followers
✅ **Turn criticism into content** - "Someone asked why we [X]... here's the truth:"
✅ **Batch content on Sundays** - Plan and prepare week ahead to stay consistent
✅ **Share the struggle** - Behind-the-scenes failures resonate more than polished wins
✅ **Research hashtag performance** - Use LinkedIn's search to see hashtag activity

## 📞 Month-End Reflection & Planning

After completing the 30-day calendar, schedule a 1-hour reflection session:

### Questions to Ask Yourself:

1. **What content got the most engagement?** (Save the format/topic for reuse)
2. **Which platform drove the most leads?** (Double down here)
3. **What was hardest to maintain?** (Adjust or automate in Month 2)
4. **Did my follower quality improve?** (Check who's connecting - are they ICP?)
5. **What surprised me?** (Unexpected viral post, new audience insight)

### Month 2 Adjustments:

- **Double down** on what worked (e.g., if carousels got 5x engagement, do 3/week)
- **Cut or reduce** underperforming content types
- **Test new formats** (LinkedIn Live, longer videos, Twitter Spaces)
- **Introduce series** ("Founder Friday", "SaaS Tips Tuesday")
- **Guest appearances** (Interview other founders on your posts/stories)

### Long-Term Milestones (3-6 Months):

- 5,000+ LinkedIn followers
- 3,000+ Instagram followers
- 10+ inbound demo requests per week from social
- Speaking invitation at local startup event
- Featured in 1-2 industry publications
